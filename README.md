# Style Grid v5.0

A visual style selector for Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge.
Replaces the default dropdown with a searchable, categorized grid.

A grid/gallery-based style selector extension for [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge). Replaces the default dropdown with a searchable, categorized grid — multi-select, favorites, source filter, instant apply, silent mode, presets, conflict detection, and more.

## What's New in v5.0

### Smart Deduplication
When viewing **All Sources**, styles that exist in multiple CSV files
are collapsed into a single card. Clicking a deduplicated card opens a
**source picker** showing each CSV variant with a prompt preview, so you
choose exactly which version to apply.

### Drag-and-Drop Category Ordering
Drag categories in the sidebar to reorder them. Your custom order is
saved automatically (browser + `data/category_order.json`) and persists
across restarts. New categories from added CSVs appear alphabetically
at the bottom.

### Batch Thumbnail Generation
Right-click any category header → **Generate previews (N missing)**.
Processes styles sequentially with a progress modal. Supports **Skip**
(jump to next style) and **Cancel** (stop after current finishes).
No parallel generation — your GPU handles one at a time.

### Persistent Category Collapse
Collapsed/expanded state for each category is saved in the browser.
Categories you collapse stay collapsed between sessions.

### Simplified Search
Search is now pure text matching against style names and descriptions.
Multi-word queries use AND logic. The previous structured operators
(`cat:`, `tag:`, `prefix:`, etc.) have been removed for simplicity.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full history.

### Previous (v4.0)

<details>
<summary>v4.0 features (click to expand)</summary>

#### Smart Search with Autocomplete
Start typing to search across all style names.
Autocomplete dropdown suggests matching styles as you type —
searches anywhere in the name, case-insensitive.

#### Thumbnail Preview on Hover
Hover over any card for 700ms to see a preview popup with:
- Thumbnail image (if uploaded or generated)
- Style display name
- Prompt content preview

**Add thumbnails two ways:**
1. Right-click a card → **Upload preview image** — pick any image from disk
2. Right-click a card → **Generate preview (SD)** — auto-generates using
   your current model with the style's prompt, fixed seed 42, 384×512px

Cards with thumbnails get a subtle left-border indicator.
Thumbnails stored in `data/thumbnails/` inside the extension folder.

#### Recommended Combos
Select any style → a row appears at the bottom showing recommended
combinations from the style's description field.

- **Blue chips** = specific styles. Click to apply immediately.
- **Orange chips** = category wildcards. Click to filter the grid.
- **Red chips** = conflicts to avoid.
- ✓ mark on chips already selected.

#### Performance
- `content-visibility: auto` for instant rendering regardless of style count
- Server-side style cache with ETag
- All API calls have error handling with visible status messages

#### Style Editor Improvements
- **Description & Combos field** for combo suggestions
- Delete and Move dialogs are proper modals
- Error feedback for failed operations

## What it does

- **Visual grid** — Styles appear as cards in a categorized grid instead of a long dropdown.
- **Dynamic categories** — Grouping by name: `PREFIX_StyleName` → category **PREFIX**; `name-with-dash` → category from the part before the dash; otherwise from the CSV filename. Colors are generated from category names.
- **Instant apply** — Click a card to select **and** immediately apply its prompt. Click again to deselect and cleanly remove it. No Apply button needed.
- **Multi-select** — Select several styles at once; each is applied independently and can be removed individually.
- **Favorites** — Star any style; a **★ Favorites** section at the top lists them. Favorites update immediately (no reload).
- **Source filter** — Dropdown to show **All Sources** or a single CSV file (e.g. `styles.csv`, `styles_integrated.csv`). Combines with search.
- **Search** — Filter by style name; works together with the source filter. Category names in the search box show only that category.
- **Category view** — Sidebar (when many categories): show **All**, **★ Favorites**, **🕑 Recent**, or one category. Compact bar when there are few categories.
- **Silent mode** — Toggle `👁 Silent` to hide style content from prompt fields. Styles are injected at generation time only and recorded in image metadata as `Style Grid: style1, style2, ...`.
- **Style presets** — Save any combination of selected styles as a named preset (📦). Load or delete presets from the menu. Stored in `data/presets.json`.
- **CSV Table Editor** — Full inline table editor for any CSV source: filter by column, edit cells, save individual rows, per-row status indicators. Access via toolbar.
- **Autocomplete apply** — Selecting an autocomplete suggestion immediately applies the style and adds it to the Selected bar.
- **Conflict detector** — Warns when selected styles contradict each other (e.g. one adds a tag that another negates). Shows a pulsing ⚠ badge with details on hover.
- **Context menu** — Right-click any card: Edit, Duplicate, Delete, Move to category, Copy prompt to clipboard.
- **Built-in style editor** — Create and edit styles directly from the grid (➕ or right-click → Edit). Changes are written to CSV — no manual file editing needed.
- **Recent history** — 🕑 section showing the last 10 used styles for quick re-access.
- **Usage counter** — Tracks how many times each style was used; badge on cards. Stats in `data/usage.json`.
- **Random style** — 🎲 picks a random style (use at your own risk!).
- **Manual backup** — 💾 snapshots all CSV files to `data/backups/` (keeps last 20).
- **Import/Export** — 📥 export all styles, presets, and usage stats as JSON, or import from one.
- **Dynamic refresh** — Auto-detects CSV changes every 5 seconds; manual 🔄 button also available.
- **{prompt} placeholder highlight** — Styles containing `{prompt}` are marked with a ⟳ icon.
- **Collapse / Expand** — Collapse or expand all category blocks. **Compact** mode for a denser layout.
- **Select All** — Per-category "Select All" to toggle the whole group.
- **Selected summary** — Footer shows selected styles as removable tags; the trigger button shows a count badge.
- **Preferences** — Source choice and compact mode are saved in the browser (survive refresh).
- **Both tabs** — Separate state for txt2img and img2img; same behavior on both.
- **Smart tag deduplication** — When applying multiple styles, duplicate tags are automatically skipped. Works in both normal and silent mode.
- **Source-aware randomizer** — The 🎲 button respects the selected CSV source: if a specific file is selected, random picks only from that file.
- **Search clear button** — × button in the search field for quick clear.
- **Drag-and-drop prompt ordering** — Tags of selected styles in the footer can be dragged to change order. The prompt updates in real time; user text stays in place.
- **Category wildcard injection** — Right-click on a category header → "Add as wildcard to prompt" inserts all styles of the category as `__sg_CATEGORY__` into the prompt. Compatible with Dynamic Prompts.

### Browsing and filtering

- **Categories** — Styles are grouped (e.g. BASE, BODY, ★ Favorites, 🕑 Recent). Click a category in the sidebar (or **All** / **★ Favorites** in the compact bar) to show only that group.
- **Source** — Use the dropdown to the left of the search bar: **All Sources** or a specific CSV file. Only styles from that source are shown.
- **Search** — Type in the search box to filter by style name. Search applies on top of the current source and category view.

### Selecting and applying styles

- **Click a card** to select and apply it instantly — the style's prompt is added to your prompt fields immediately. Click again to deselect and remove.
- **Select All** on a category header to select or clear all styles in that category.
- **Star (★)** on a card to add or remove it from **★ Favorites**; the Favorites block updates at once.
- **Silent mode** — When `👁 Silent` is active, clicking a card selects it, but prompts are not modified visually. Styles are injected during generation and appear in image metadata.
- You can reorder applied styles by dragging their tags in the Selected footer. The prompt field updates to reflect the new order.

### Prompt behavior

- Styles without `{prompt}` have their prompt **appended** (comma-separated).
- Styles with `{prompt}` **wrap** your existing prompt (e.g. `masterpiece, {prompt}, highres` inserts your text in place of `{prompt}`). These are marked with a ⟳ icon on the card.

## Style CSV format and categories

Use the standard Forge/A1111 CSV format:

```csv
name,prompt,negative_prompt
BASE_Illustrious_Quality,"masterpiece, best quality, highres","lowres, bad anatomy"
STYLE_Watercolor,"watercolor painting, soft edges",""
myfile_My_Custom_Style,"custom prompt here",""
```

### How categories are chosen

| Rule | Example | Category |
|------|---------|----------|
| Name contains `_` | `BODY_Thicc` | **BODY** (uppercase before first `_`) |
| Name contains `-` (no `_`) | `sai-anime` | **sai** (before first `-`) |
| Else | `SomeStyle` | From CSV filename (e.g. **Styles_integrated**) |
| Fallback | — | **OTHER** |

Category colors are generated from the category name (no fixed palette).

---

## Data files

The extension stores its data in the `data/` folder:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `data/presets.json` | Saved style presets |
| `data/usage.json` | Per-style usage counters and timestamps |
| `data/category_order.json` | Custom sidebar category ordering (auto-created on drag) |
| `data/backups/` | Timestamped CSV backups (up to 20) |
| `data/thumbnails/` | Style preview images (keyed by name hash) |

These files are gitignored and created automatically.

---

## Adding more styles

1. Use the CSV format above.
2. Put it in:
   - Forge root (next to `styles.csv`), or
   - The extension's **styles/** folder.
3. The grid auto-refreshes within 5 seconds, or click 🔄 to reload immediately.

You can also create styles directly from the grid using ➕ or right-click → Edit.

---

## CSV Format

Five columns: `name, prompt, negative_prompt, description, category`

The `description` field supports combo suggestions:

Combos: STYLE_X; SCENE_Outdoor; LIGHTING_*
Conflicts: do not mix with BASE_Pony

## Style Packs

Style packs are distributed separately.
Find official packs on [CivitAI](https://civitai.com) (search "Style Grid pack").
Place screenshots in docs/screenshots/.

## Installation

### From URL (Forge Extensions tab)

1. **Extensions** → **Install from URL**
2. Paste the repository URL
3. **Install**, then restart the UI

### Manual

```bash
cd /path/to/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/extensions
git clone <this-repo-url>
```

Then restart the UI.

---

## Compatibility

- Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge (latest)
- Dark and light themes (panel, cards, search, source dropdown)
- txt2img and img2img

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to try |
|-------|-------------|
| Trigger button not visible | Enable the extension in the Extensions tab; do a full UI restart; check console for `[Style Grid]` messages. |
| Styles not loading | Ensure CSVs are in Forge root or the extension's `styles/` folder; check `name,prompt,negative_prompt` header and encoding (UTF-8). |
| Conflict warning wrong | The detector compares comma-separated tokens. Complex prompts with shared common words may trigger false positives. |
| Silent mode not working | Ensure the extension's `process()` hook is running — check that `Style Grid` appears in your image metadata after generation. |
| Drag-and-drop not working | Ensure you're dragging the style tags in the footer area (bottom of Style Grid panel), not the cards in the grid. |
