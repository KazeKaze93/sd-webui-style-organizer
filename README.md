# Style Grid for Forge

Style Grid replaces the default style dropdown with a fast, visual interface for browsing, selecting, and applying styles in Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge.

It supports:
- category-based browsing
- source-aware filtering
- deduplicated All Sources view with source picker
- favorites and recent styles
- drag reorder of selected styles
- presets, backup, import/export
- thumbnail generation/upload and cleanup tools

See `CHANGELOG.md` for full release history.

## Quick Start

1. Open `txt2img` or `img2img`.
2. Click the **Style Grid** trigger button to open the panel.
3. Pick a source (`All Sources` or a specific CSV).
4. Search or browse categories.
5. Click a style card to apply/unapply.
6. Use the **top bar** icon buttons (right of the search box) for presets, backup, import/export, etc.

## img2img support

Style Grid works in both generation tabs:
- txt2img
- img2img

Behavior is the same in both modes (source filter, deduplication, favorites/recent, context menus, previews, presets).
The small tab badge in the panel header shows the active host context.

## Core Workflow

### 1) Browse and filter styles
- Use the left sidebar for category filtering.
- Use source dropdown for CSV-level filtering.
- Use search box for instant name filtering.

![Browse and filter styles](docs/screenshots/browse-and-filter.png)

### Search and autocomplete
- Type in the search box to filter cards by style name in real time.
- A suggestion popup appears while you type and shows matching style names with their category.
- Use arrow keys + Enter to pick a suggestion quickly, or click the item with mouse.
- Search respects your current source/category view, so results stay relevant to what is on screen.

![Search with autocomplete suggestions](docs/screenshots/search-autocomplete.png)

### 2) Apply styles from cards
- Card click toggles selection and applies/unapplies style.
- Selected styles are tracked in the bottom selected bar.
- Reorder selected styles by dragging chips in the selected bar.

![Apply styles from cards — selection and bottom bar](docs/screenshots/apply-and-reorder.png)

### 3) All Sources and duplicate names (source picker)
- With **All Sources** selected, the grid shows **one card per style name** even if that name appears in several CSV files.
- If the same name exists in more than one file, the **first click** on that card does not toggle the style yet — it opens a small **source picker** next to the card.
- The picker lists each duplicate as the **CSV file name only** (no folder path, no `.csv` extension). Choose the row you want; that variant is applied like a normal selection.
- Click outside the picker to close it without applying.
- If you pick a **specific source** in the dropdown, you always see that file’s styles only — duplicates from other files are not shown together, so the picker is not used.

### 4) Favorites and recent
- **Favorites:** right‑click a style card → **Add to Favorites** / **Remove from Favorites** (there is no star icon on the tile itself).
- **Recent** lists the last styles you applied (up to 10), grouped by category like the main grid.
- Open **Favorites** or **Recent** in the left sidebar to filter the grid to those lists.

![Favorites — styles saved via context menu](docs/screenshots/favorites-view.png)

![Browsing a category — tiles show names only; use sidebar or context menu for favorites](docs/screenshots/favorites-in-category.png)

### 5) Category context menu: wildcards and previews

**Where to open it**

- **Right-click** a **category row** in the **left sidebar** (the colored category list).
- **Right-click** the **category header** in the **main grid** when the view is grouped by category (e.g. **All**, **Favorites**, **Recent** — the sticky row with `▼ CATEGORY (count)` and **Select All**).  
  *(A normal **left-click** on that header only collapses/expands the section.)*

**Menu actions**

| Item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Add category as wildcard** | Inserts a token into the **positive prompt** on the Forge side: `{sg:<category>}`. The category name is normalized to **lowercase** to match how styles are grouped. |
| **Generate previews** | Queues **thumbnail generation** for styles in that category (batch job in the host). |

**How `{sg:…}` wildcards work**

- **Syntax:** `{sg:<category>}` — curly braces, the prefix `sg:`, then the **category label** as it appears in Style Grid (e.g. `ACCESSORY` or `accessory`). Only this pattern is special; the regex is `\{sg:…\}` (see `scripts/stylegrid/wildcards.py`).
- **When it runs:** tokens are expanded **at generation time** inside Style Grid’s own processing hook (`scripts/style_grid.py`), **before** the rest of the prompt is handled like a normal Forge prompt.
- **What gets inserted:** one **random** style from that category; the replacement text is that style’s **`prompt`** field from CSV (not `negative_prompt`). Category matching is **case-insensitive**.
- **Where you can put it:** positive or negative prompt box — **both strings are scanned**. If the category is unknown or empty, the `{sg:…}` text is **left as-is** (no error).
- You can type or paste tokens manually; the context menu only inserts the same format.

**Compatibility with other “wildcard” extensions (e.g. `stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards` / Dynamic Prompts `__file__` style)**

- Those stacks usually recognize **different** syntax — commonly **`__name__`** (double underscores) or other Dynamic Prompts / custom grammar — not `{sg:…}`.
- Style Grid only looks for **`{sg:…}`**; other extensions only interpret **their** patterns. The two do **not** use the same delimiters, so they **do not fight over the same text** in normal use.
- **You do not need** the Automatic1111 wildcards extension (or any extra wildcard plugin) **for Style Grid’s `{sg:…}` feature** — it is implemented **inside this extension** (Python `resolve_sg_wildcards` + your style CSV data). Other wildcard extensions remain optional for their own `__…__` / file-based workflows.

**Generate previews — sidebar vs grid**

- From the **grid** header menu, **Generate previews (N missing)** appears only when the UI thinks **N** styles in that category still need a cached preview.
- From the **sidebar** category menu, **Generate previews…** is always shown for that category (full pass for the category).

![Category header context menu — wildcard and missing previews](docs/screenshots/category-context-wildcard-previews.png)

![Category header context menu (alternate view)](docs/screenshots/category-context-wildcard-previews-2.png)

### 6) Style card context menu

**Where to open it**

- **Right-click** a **style card** in the grid. *(Left-click still applies the normal select / source-picker rules.)*

**Menu actions**

| Item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Select** / **Deselect** | Same as a left-click on the card: applies or removes the style from the active selection (and host prompt), without opening the duplicate-source picker. |
| **Add to Favorites** / **Remove from Favorites** | Toggles the star list for this style name. |
| **Copy prompt** | Copies this style’s **`prompt`** text to the clipboard. |
| **Edit** | Opens the host **style editor** for this style. |
| **Duplicate** | Opens the host flow to duplicate the style (typically into the same or chosen source). |
| **Move to category…** | Opens the host dialog to change the style’s **category** field. |
| **Generate preview (SD)** | Runs **thumbnail generation** for this style (Stable Diffusion–based preview in the host). |
| **Upload preview image** | Opens the host **file picker** to set a custom thumbnail image. |
| **Delete** | Removes the style (host confirms and updates CSV). |

Click **outside** the menu, or move the pointer **off** the menu panel, to close it.

![Style card context menu](docs/screenshots/style-card-context-menu.png)

### 7) Thumbnail previews and the hover popup

**Generating a preview**

- **Per style:** open the style’s context menu (**right-click** the card) → **Generate preview (SD)**. The host runs an SD render and saves an image under `data/thumbnails/` (see **Data and Persistence**).
- **Per category:** use the **category** context menu → **Generate previews…** (see §5).

After a successful run, the iframe is notified so the UI can refresh that style’s thumbnail version.

**What the card shows**

- The **grid card** is a compact label (name and category color accent). The **generated image is not shown inside the tile** — you see it when you **hover**.

**Hover popup (preview window)**

- **Pause ~300 ms** on a card to open the popup (reduces flicker when moving the mouse quickly).
- **Top:** the thumbnail image (if the file exists and loads). If the image is missing or fails to load, you still get the **text** below.
- **Title:** the style display name.
- **Prompt:** first **120 characters** of the style’s **`prompt`** column, with `...` if longer.
- **Negative:** first **60 characters** of **`negative_prompt`**, prefixed with **−** and shown in a muted red tone.

The popup is **fixed** near the card and flips **above** or **below** depending on available space.

### 8) Fullscreen mode

- Click the **Fullscreen** button in the top-right corner of the panel to switch between floating window mode and edge-to-edge view.
- Fullscreen gives the grid and sidebar more horizontal space, which is useful for large category lists and long browsing sessions.
- Click the same button again to return to the regular floating panel size.

![Fullscreen mode](docs/screenshots/fullscreen-mode.png)

## Top bar (icon buttons on the right)

**What this means:** not a separate “toolbar” window — it is the **top header row** of the Style Grid panel: logo, `txt2img`/`img2img` tag, **source** dropdown, **search**, then a row of **small icon buttons on the right**. Hover an icon to see its tooltip.

![Top bar — icon buttons (right of search)](docs/screenshots/top-bar-icons.png)

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| 👁 | **Silent mode** — styles are applied **at generate time** (hidden JSON inputs), not in the prompt text fields. Turning silent **off** clears that list and resets the V2 selection; toggling a style off while silent also removes it from generate-time injection. |
| 🎲 | **Random style** — picks a random style (respects the active source filter). |
| 📦 | **Presets** — save/load/delete style sets. |
| 💾 | **Backup** — creates CSV backup snapshot(s). |
| 📥 | **Import / Export** — export/import styles, presets, usage. |
| 📋 | **CSV table editor** — opens the table editor for CSV sources. |
| 🧹 | **Clear** — clears all selected styles in the panel and on the host prompt. |
| ▪ | **Compact mode** — toggles a denser card layout. |
| ↕ | **Collapse all** or **Expand all** category sections (depends on current state). |
| ➕ | **New style** — creates a style in the **currently selected CSV** (`All Sources` must be switched to a specific file first). |
| *(number)* | Shows how many styles are selected; **⚠️** may appear if conflicts are detected (hover for details). |
| Fullscreen | Toggles between the floating panel size and edge-to-edge layout. |
| ✕ | **Close** — closes the Style Grid panel. |

| `data/category_order.json` | Persisted category order |
| `data/backups/` | CSV backups |
| `data/thumbnails/` | Thumbnail image cache |

Local UI state is also stored in browser localStorage (active source, favorites, recent, compact/collapse preferences).

---

## CSV Format

Primary style fields:
- `name`
- `prompt`
- `negative_prompt`
- optional metadata: `description`, `category`

Detailed specification: `docs/CSV_FORMAT.md`.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to check |
|---|---|
| Panel does not open | Extension enabled + full Forge restart. |
| Styles missing | CSV location/encoding/header correctness. |
| Source picker not shown | Must be in `All Sources`, and style must exist in multiple CSVs. |
| Order seems wrong | Check active source and category order persistence rules. |
| Thumbnails not appearing | Verify generation/upload status and `data/thumbnails/` permissions. |
