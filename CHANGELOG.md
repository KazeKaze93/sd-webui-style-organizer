## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **V2 iframe entry:** `GET /style_grid/ui` (FastAPI in `stylegrid/routes.py`) serves `ui/dist/index.html`. Helper **`_get_ui_html()`** rewrites **every** relative asset URL (`src` / `href` with a `./…` path — scripts, stylesheets, favicon, etc.) to Gradio `/file=extensions/sd-webui-style-organizer/ui/dist/…` with a **fresh** cache-busting `?v=<unix time>` on **each** response so browser caches cannot serve stale chunks after rebuilds. The host sets the iframe `src` to `/style_grid/ui?t=<timestamp>` so the HTML document request stays busted as well.
- **Sidebar Presets (V2):** the **Presets** category in the React grid uses the same **`StyleCard`** tiles as style rows; click sends **`SG_LOAD_PRESET`** to the host. **`ThumbnailPreview`** accepts optional **`presetName`** and skips the hover thumbnail popup for those cards.
- `POST /style_grid/thumbnail/generate` accepts an optional `source` field in the JSON body (active CSV path string) so thumbnail generation picks the correct row when the same style `name` exists in more than one file; the host passes `state[tab].selectedSource` from `generateThumbnail`.
- CSV parse/load: optional `_source` field (basename, aligned with `source`) and tests for loading the same filename from different scan directories (`3488b64`).
- React iframe frontend (V2) integrated into Forge panel lifecycle (`dc5f544`, `589ca79`).
- Shadcn-based UI composition and component library (`ui/src/components/ui/*`) with typed frame bridge (`ui/src/bridge.ts`) (`dc5f544`, `e841334`).
- New V2 capabilities: favorites/recent, usage counters, conflict checks, toast notifications, thumbnail progress modal, random/backup/import-export actions (`3f042ba`, `5277f8f`, `c8c9c2b`, `9ffda9c`, `0641448`, `e98ab3b`).
- Category/source UX improvements: source filtering, persisted category ordering, and source-aware style dedup/source selection behavior (`e841334`, `6c2e8e4`, `af23d07`).
- Fullscreen/windowed interactions with outside-click handling and host scroll lock control (`930f6b6`, `fc9d9dc`, `72c77f2`).

### Changed
- **V2 React performance (store):** **`selectFilteredStyles(...)`** is a **standalone exported function** in `ui/src/store/stylesStore.ts` (pure filter/dedupe logic). **`StyleGrid`** and **`Sidebar`** use Zustand **`useShallow`** so they do not re-render on unrelated store updates (e.g. selection, toasts, conflicts). **`StyleGrid`** memoizes the filtered style list with **`useMemo`** from subscribed fields.
- **V2 iframe document cache (follow-up):** the floating panel iframe no longer uses `/file=…/ui/dist/index.html` directly; it uses **`/style_grid/ui`** (see **Added**). Older changelog notes about `index.html?sgui=…` refer to the previous host `src` pattern.
- **SG_LOAD_PRESET (host):** if the requested preset is not yet present in `state[tab].presets`, the message handler **`fetch`es `/style_grid/presets/list`**, assigns the result to host state, then runs the same **`loadPreset`** as the modal **Load** button.
- **Thumbnails (HTTP):** `GET /style_grid/thumbnail` no longer branches on a `source` query parameter for file resolution. The handler tries `get_thumbnail_path(name)`, then unique `get_thumbnail_path(name, source_file)` candidates from `get_cached_styles()` for that name in **reverse** list order. `POST /style_grid/thumbnail/generate` accepts optional `source` in the JSON body for row disambiguation (see **Added**).
- **Forge script `process()` inputs:** `StyleGridScript.ui()` passes hidden `style_grid_silent_*` and `style_grid_source_*` textboxes to the script runner; `process()` reads silent JSON from `args[0]` and active source filter from `args[1]` (wildcard expansion still runs first and respects selected source when present). `styles_data` / `selected_styles` / apply trigger remain in the DOM for the host script only (`a8819d6`).
- **CSV table editor:** **disabled** in the product UI (📋 inactive in React and host toolbars; EN/RU tooltips and native `title` explain temporary unavailability). Full implementation preserved as a **block comment** in `javascript/style_grid.js`; live `openCsvTableEditor` is a no-op stub. `SG_CSV_EDITOR` remains in `ui/src/bridge.ts` for typing; the host responds with an informational **`SG_TOAST`** instead of opening the overlay (legacy handler body left commented beside the active branch). Full-screen editor styles (`.sg-csv-*`, `.sg-csv-editor-btn-disabled`) live in `style.css` for future re-enable. *When previously enabled:* target CSV followed **`getStoredSource(tab)`**; **All Sources** was rejected; iframe-triggered open used the visible `style_grid_wrapper_*` tab (`c0dff77`, `62b083d`).
- **Host toolbar:** icon row vertical alignment; Style Grid trigger button placement follows the target control row structure (`c0dff77`, `6ad888e`).
- **DOM helper `qs`:** optional root element with `gradioApp()` fallback for Gradio-scoped queries (`d0c135b`).
- **Host → iframe:** `SG_HOST_TAB` updates the React store when the visible txt2img/img2img context changes so non-init style pushes keep the correct tab (`c0dff77`).
- **Styles merge (`load_all_styles`):** uniqueness when combining CSVs is `(absolute source_file, style name)` instead of `(basename, name)`, so two `styles.csv` in different folders no longer drop each other’s rows (`3488b64`).
- **V2 deduplication by name** applies only when **All sources** is active: shared helper `dedupeStylesByNameForAllSources` drives **`selectFilteredStyles`** (grid) and search suggestions; a single selected CSV lists every row from that file (`3488b64`).
- **V2 host → iframe:** periodic refresh sends the full merged style list to the frame (no host-side name filter); `postSGInitToFrame` builds the initial list from API `categories` like other init paths (`3488b64`).
- V2 grid and search items use stable React keys from `source_file` + `name` so duplicate names within one CSV do not clash (`3488b64`).
- Production build artifacts under `ui/dist/` updated in-repo for the current V2 bundle (`8a38e31`).
- **V2 bundle:** `ui/dist/` rebuilt for conflict popover and conflict-list store fixes (PR #53, `51e19b8`).
- Style Grid host ↔ frame messaging flow refactored to SG_* postMessage contract and on-demand re-init/update pushes (`589ca79`, `e6276da`).
- Sidebar/category behavior refined for per-source ordering logic and All Sources fallback handling (`6c2e8e4`, `af23d07`).
- `docs/API.md` backend route definitions now originate from modular backend route registration (`stylegrid/routes.py` via `scripts/style_grid.py`) instead of monolithic script split assumptions.
- **Documentation:** README expanded (workflows, wildcards, search, fullscreen, img2img, testing; Quick Start / top-bar table / troubleshooting include the **disabled** CSV table editor); top-bar **Presets** / **Backup** rows note iframe sync and backup toasts; `docs/API.md` § `POST /backup` documents `ok` / `error` and skipped missing files; `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` adds outside-click exclusions, `SG_BACKUP`, preset Load, and `SG_APPLY` host `selected` state; maintainer re-enable steps for CSV editor, `SG_CSV_EDITOR` toast, screenshots checklist (`docs/screenshots/README.md`); PNG assets under `docs/screenshots/` refreshed for the current UI.
- **Documentation (paths + API):** References to backend modules now use the `stylegrid/` package layout (`stylegrid/routes.py`, `stylegrid/wildcards.py`). `docs/API.md` documents `GET /style_grid/thumbnail` resolution (legacy hash, then source-aware paths from the styles cache) and optional `source` on `POST /style_grid/thumbnail/generate`; iframe routing notes; limitations of `DELETE /style_grid/thumbnail`. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` covers `SG_SOURCE_CHANGE` / `SG_GENERATE_CATEGORY_PREVIEWS` and thumbnail behavior. `docs/CSV_FORMAT.md` adds thumbnail vs `source_file`. Root `README.md` and `ui/README.md` wildcards/API paths aligned.
- **Documentation (V2 follow-up):** `README.md`, `ui/README.md`, `docs/API.md` § **GET `/ui`**, and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` updated for **`_get_ui_html()`** (per-request `?v=` on all relative assets), exported **`selectFilteredStyles`**, and **`useShallow`** in **StyleGrid** / **Sidebar**; dedupe changelog line now names **`selectFilteredStyles`** instead of the removed store method.
- **Repo hygiene:** `.gitignore` extended for Python virtualenvs, caches, and coverage output (`2a9d7b8`).
- **V2 store:** restoring `activeSource` from persistence matches stored values against loaded sources via basename-aware `resolveSourceInList`; `setStyles` sends `SG_SOURCE_CHANGE` to the host only when a non-empty source is active.

### Removed
- **V2 style cards:** inline favorite star control removed from tiles — add/remove **Favorites** only via the **style card context menu** (right‑click), reducing clutter and freeing space for labels.

### Fixed
- **Style Grid panel (host):** capture-phase `mousedown` outside the floating frame no longer closes the panel when the user interacts with **host-spawned** UI (e.g. style editor / source picker) — clicks on `.sg-editor-overlay` or `.sg-source-picker` are ignored for auto-close.
- **Backup (`POST /style_grid/backup`):** server wraps `backup_csv_files()` in `try`/`except` and returns JSON `{ "error": "…" }` instead of an unhandled 500; `backup_csv_files()` skips paths that are not existing files (avoids crashes when a listed CSV is missing). Host `SG_BACKUP` fetch treats non-OK HTTP, JSON parse failures, and `{ ok: false }` / `{ error }` with toasts (including “Nothing to backup” when no CSV was copied).
- **Presets (host selection vs save):** `SG_APPLY` in non-silent mode no longer clears `state[tab].selected` to an empty set — it adds the applied style like silent mode, so **Save preset** records the real selection; `SG_UNAPPLY` removes the style from `selected` / `selectedOrder`. **Load preset** clears the iframe selection (`SG_CLEAR_SELECTION`) then posts `SG_STYLE_APPLIED` per loaded name so the **V2 selected bar** stays in sync.
- **Silent mode (V2):** fixed generate-time styles sticking after manual deselect — `SG_UNAPPLY` now clears the same host `selected` set that feeds `style_grid_silent_*` for `process()`, and silent iframe apply keeps `selectedOrder` aligned. Turning silent off clears host silent-only entries and notifies iframes (`SG_CLEAR_SELECTION`); **iframe highlight/chips may still appear selected until interaction** — that is cosmetic; generation follows the cleared host silent input. Follow-up: cross-tab silent toggling, `setSilentGradio`, and `process()` arg indexing aligned with the reduced `ui()` return tuple (`19918f1`, `c8d41d2`, `a8819d6`).
- **Wildcard pass:** positive/negative strings default to empty when null before `{sg:…}` resolution (`d0c135b`).
- Selecting one source (CSV) no longer hides styles that only collide **by name** with another file: backend keeps both rows, and the V2 refresh path no longer re-deduplicates by name before `SG_STYLES_UPDATE` (`3488b64`).
- Improved iframe close/escape behavior and minimized accidental host/page interaction conflicts while V2 panel is open (`930f6b6`, `72c77f2`).
- Fixed several V2 synchronization issues after backend refresh/update flows (`e6276da`, `589ca79`).
- **Search autocomplete:** suggestions respect the active source filter (matches only the selected CSV when one is chosen). With **All Sources**, the list spans loaded styles and **dedupes by style name** like the grid (`b93de7a`, `3488b64`).
- **V2 style conflicts (PR #53, `51e19b8`):** clearing **all** selections or **deselecting an entire category** now resets or recomputes conflicts — `clearAll` also clears `conflicts`, and the bulk-unapply branch in `selectAllInCategory` calls `detectConflicts()` after `SG_UNAPPLY`.
- **V2 conflict popover (PR #53, `51e19b8`):** each row shows a **✕** control to remove the conflicting style (`styleB`) via `toggleStyle`, resolving the `Style` from `selectedStyles` first then the full `styles` list; the panel uses `max-w-[min(20rem,calc(100vw-2.5rem))]`, wrapped text (`min-w-0`, `break-words`), and `pt-1` instead of `mt-1` so the action stays visible and easier to reach under hover.
- **Thumbnails:** `GET /style_grid/thumbnail` serves the legacy name-only file when present, otherwise walks cached rows with the same `name` in reverse order and returns the first existing source-hashed file; preview URLs may still include `source` / `v` for client cache behavior, but path resolution is server-driven from the cached style list. Per-style **Generate preview (SD)** sends `source` in the **POST** body so generation targets the correct CSV row.
- **V2 ↔ host (source + batch previews):** category batch thumbnail jobs use the iframe-posted `source` and a fresh `/style_grid/styles` list filtered by category and source; `window` `message` handlers for txt2img/img2img only handle events from their own iframe (`e.source === frame.contentWindow`); redundant `SG_SOURCE_CHANGE` updates with the same path are skipped after the tab state exists.
